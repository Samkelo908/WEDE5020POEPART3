                <p>When WanderWorld was first established in 2005, it was a hobby project for a group of passionate travelers who wanted to make travel amazing and accessible to all. What started out as a little project has grown into a top travel company that is committed to offering insightful information and producing remarkable travel experiences.</p><!--:w3school.1998.-->
                <p>We have had the honor of meeting other travelers, learning about various cultures, and experiencing firsthand the life-changing effects of travel throughout our adventure. Stories of discovery, education, and the delight of teaching our community about the wonders of the globe have been interconnected throughout our history.</p><!--:w3school.1998.-->
